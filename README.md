**Welcome to BraidOS! The world's first 'Braided System'!**

##What are these 'Braids'? 

###Mathematical Concept
A super-concise introduction to some of the mathematical concepts from Braid Theory: Find a complete introduction here: [http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/publications/Chiodo.pdf](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/publications/Chiodo.pdf)

- **Mathematical Braids** (Taken from linked paper)
	-  "Begin by taking a unit cube, and in it we place n strands of string, subject to the following conditions:
		-  		No part of any strand lies outside the cube.
		- 		Each strand begins on the top face of the cube, and ends on the bottom
		- 		face.
		- 		No two strands intersect.
		-  		As we traverse any strand from the top face, we are always moving downwards.
	- This means that no strand has any horizontal segment, or any segment that ‘loops up’. The resulting collection of strands is called an n-braid."

- **Braid Diagrams**
	- Braid diagrams are 2-dimensional projections of Braids. It's the model you should picture in your mind as you are learning about 'Generalized Braids' -- the Abstract Machine Model.

###Generalized Braids -- A Better Abstract Machine Model (*Still a very early concept*)

Basic concept (**if we consider *all* things to be a 'Type'**):

- **Strands** (Sequence of Types -- Paths Over CDT Space)
- **Permutations** (Action CDT's in the given Space)
- **Coordinations** (Coordinate Types (CDT's) within the Space)
- **Space** (Composite Data Type (CDT) Space {e.g. memory})

We consider Generalized Braids to be a superior Abstract Machine model over Universal Turing Machines.

Since Braids are just an abstraction, these concepts will be what we will call: **System Types** or **System CDTs**
