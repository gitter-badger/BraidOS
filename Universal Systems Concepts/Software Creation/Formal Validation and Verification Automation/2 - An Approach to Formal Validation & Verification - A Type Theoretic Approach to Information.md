#Type-Theoretic Approach to Information (An Approach to Formal Validation and Verification Part 2)

##Introduction

In this second paper, we would like to address constructing an *approach* to Formal Validation & Verification for software creation in practical computation.

##Type-Theoretic Information Theory (T.T.I.T.)

##Optimization as an approach to F.V.V. (Formal Validation & Verification)

##Compression is Optimization in T.T.I.T.
Thus Optimal Compression = Maximal Optimization i.e. Formally Validated and Verified System Type Generation (??) -- strictly in Information Type Space.


##Information-Theoretic Approach (From E.T.T. Paper)

L.P.-2 We would also like to mention (but not construct) an approach to Explicit Type Theory via information theory. We hypothesize that there should be a method to 'explore' Explicit Type Theory' using a: 'Generalized Optimal Compression/Decompression' scheme, as compression is an approach to “rigorous definitions” for data types (Code-Theoretic i.e. via Coding Theory). We hope the generalized scheme can be used to find 'rigorous definitions' i.e. Types(whatever that may mean). We plan on expounding on this in a later paper.
