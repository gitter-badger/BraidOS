##BraidOS - Symmetry

**Symmetry implies conservation**

###Symmetry in Mathematics

Symmetry is a natural bijection between two sets (or categorically -- a structure preserving morphism between two objects inside the Category -- as in the case of the Category of Groups, a bijection is a group isomorphism).



###Symmetry in Computing
**In computing, Symmetry implies immutability**

The 'set' is a set of types (CDTs) that is shared (bijected) between componets in a system.

- Networking (Bijection = Protocol i.e. a set of shared types)
- Software Tests (Conservation of Validity & Verification)
- Consensus
- Atomic Operations (are Symmetric Functions)
- Copy Functions for arbitrary Data
