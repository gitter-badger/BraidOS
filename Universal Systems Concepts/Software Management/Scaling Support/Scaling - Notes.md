#Scaling Support

##Distributed Computing

Using (Mathematical) **Configuration Spaces** we think in terms of **Distributed Control Systems**.

**In order to achieve "Trans-Nativity" we need something similar to how neurology works i.e. independent nodes working as a common System (a single architecture). Using this method gives near infinite scalability.** 

Possibly: **Distributed Consumption Optimization** (Reactive Homeostasis). Sub-clusters can isolate themselves in a 'reaction' mechanism to incoming information i.e. they can become a temporarily closed Trans-Machine (even if 'spatially disjointed').

In this way we feed information to the system and we can define external I/O nodes (or allow for any node to have external I/O).
