#Generalized Braids & Concurrency

##Multi-Braided Programming

Multiple braids via  various concurrency schemes including: Braid Schedulers (based on the mathematics of Braid Groups).



##Category of Concurrent Programs

We will work to show that 'Generalized Braids' can be seen as perfect replacements for a multi-threaded program; as well as the Category of Concurrent Programs being a Symmetric Monoidal Category.

###Monoidal Categories
