# Generalized Braids & Concurrency #


**Abstract:**
This repository is dedicated to building up a theoretical framework for a new abstraction of reliable concurrency and parallelism in computing.

We will be using mathematical concepts from:

- Braid Theory
- Category Theory

and will work to show that 'Generalized Braids' can be seen as perfect replacements for a multithreaded program; as well as the Category of Concurrent Programs being a Symmetric Monoidal Category.

We use concepts taken from multiple sources and create a custom abstraction method for working programmers to use in (more easily) defining concurrent software architectures.
